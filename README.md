<h1 align="center"> 👋 Rick & Morty Project! 👋</h1>
Hello, my name is Joel Dupraz, I am a student of Henry, of the Fullstack developer career and I present my Rick and Morty integrator project, developed according to the knowledge I learned in Front end, in Back end and database. It also consumes resources of a corresponding Api.


<h2 align="left">📋 Pre-requisites 📋</h2>

In order to access and navigate you will need an email and a password. As a test, you can use:

```
Username: admin@hotmail.com
Password: 1password
```

<h2 align="left">🔧 Instalación 🔧</h2>

If you want to be able to have this project, you can apply the following command in your console: 

```
git clone https://github.com/JoelDUAR/rickandMorty.git
```

Once you have cloned the repository, perform the installation of the necessary dependencies, in the same console, through the following command:

```
npm install
```
Finally, on two different consoles, placing each of the consoles on the "back" and "front" folders, respectively, apply the following command equally:

```
npm start
```

Great, now you can see this application running in your browser. Success with those modifications.🚀🚀
